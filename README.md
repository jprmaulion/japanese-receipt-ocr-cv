# Simple Japanese Receipt OCR Tool ðŸ§¾
This tool creates a side-by-side visualization of Japanese receipt OCR processing:
- Left panel shows the original receipt with detected text regions (red boxes)
- Right panel displays recognized text with confidence scores (blue boxes)

## Current Limitations
- Detects empty spaces in borders
- Variable confidence scores (0-100%)
- Optimized for Japanese convenience store receipts

## Next Steps
- Image preprocessing (e.g., improve contrast)
- Border space removal
- Support for other languages like Chinese and Korean

## Personal Note
As a beginner in Computer Vision, this project represents my first steps into OCR implementation. While simple, it's helped me understand the basics of text detection and recognition in images. I'm looking forward to exploring more CV applications! Feel free to shoot me an email if you have questions: jprmaulion[at]gmail[dot]com.
